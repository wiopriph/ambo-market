        We also collect, use and share ‘aggregated data’, such as statistical or demographic data for a number of
        purposes. Aggregated data may be derived from your Personal Data, but once in aggregated form it will no longer
        constitute Personal Data as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may
        aggregate your Behavioural Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Platform feature.
        However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly
        identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy.

        details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, political opinions, information about
        your health, genetic and/or biometric data, and information about criminal offences and convictions).

        We advise you not to share any of that data with us (for example, through our support chat function) or other
        users of the Platform (for example, through the user-to-user chat function). However, should you choose to share
        such data with us or other users of the Platform, you consent to us processing such data in accordance with this

        We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it as listed below, unless we
        reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
        purpose. If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and
        we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so (please refer to the ‘Changes to this Privacy Policy’

        What is our ‘legal basis’ for processing your Personal Data?
      </p>

      <p>
        In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Data, applicable privacy laws require us to
        ensure that we have a ‘legal basis’ for that use. Most commonly, we will rely on one of the following legal
        bases:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Where we need to process your Personal Data to meet our contractual obligations to you (for example, to

        <li>
          Where we have your consent to process your Personal Data for a specific purpose ("<strong>Consent</strong>").

        have the right to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Request access to your Personal Data: </strong>This allows you to receive a copy of the Personal Data
          we
          hold about you, and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Request the correction of your Personal Data: </strong>This allows you to ask for any incomplete or
          inaccurate information we hold about you to be corrected.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Request the erasure of your Personal Data: </strong>This allows you to ask us to delete or remove your
          Personal Data from our systems where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Object to the processing of your Personal Data: </strong>This allows you to object to our processing
          of
          your Personal Data for a specific purpose (for example, for marketing purposes).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Request the transfer of your Personal Data: </strong>This allows you to request the transfer of your
          Personal Data in a structured, commonly-used, machine-readable format, either to you or to a third party
          designated by you.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Withdraw your Consent: </strong>This right only exists where we are relying on your Consent to process
          your Personal Data. If you withdraw your Consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to the certain
          features of our Platform. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your Consent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Please note that not all of the rights listed above may be available to you, and some rights may only be
        exercisable in specific circumstances.

        How to exercise your rights

      <p>
        If you want to exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us.

      <p>
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
        access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
        your Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask
        you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
      </p>

      <p>
        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month of receipt. Occasionally, it may take us longer
        than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we
        will notify you and keep you updated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although we will typically not charge a fee for exercising your rights described above, we reserve the right to
        charge a reasonable fee in some circumstances (for example, if your request is unreasonable or if you submit an
        excessive number of requests).

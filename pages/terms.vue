          failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations that is caused by events outside our

          non-happening, omission or accident beyond our reasonable control. The performance of our obligations under
          these Terms of Use is deemed to be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues, and we
          will have an extension of time for performance for the duration of that period. We will use reasonable efforts
          to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which our obligations under these Terms
          of Use may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event.

          <strong>Even if we delay enforcing our rights under these Terms of Use, we can still enforce them later.</strong>
          If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms of Use, or if we
